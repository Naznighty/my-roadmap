## 🎨 Customization

Colors, spacing, and border radius are controlled through CSS custom properties in `style.css`, making it easy to re-theme the whole app from one place:

```css
:root {
  --bg: #f5f5f5;
  --surface: rgba(20, 10, 15, 0.45);
  --text: #ffffff;
  --accent: #e0507f;
  --radius: 40px;
}
```
